# goa Cellar

The goa winecellar service provides an example for the [goa](http://goa.design) web application
framework.

The service implements an API for managing wine bottles. The service is multitenant: bottles are
created in the context of an account. At this time the database is emulated with a in-memory hash.
An instance of this example is hosted at http://cellar.goa.design.

Using the excellent [httpie client](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie):

Listing bottles in account 1:
```bash
http http://cellar.goa.design/cellar/accounts/1/bottles

Creating a new account:
```bash

Showing the newly created account:
```bash
http  http://cellar.goa.design/cellar/accounts/3
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 66
Content-Type: application/vnd.goa.example.account+json; charset=utf-8

    "created_at": "",
    "created_by": "me",
    "href": "",
    "id": 3,
    "name": "sonoma"
}
```

## Generated vs. Non Generated Code

One thing to be aware of when looking at the example is that most of it is generated code. The `design` package contains the DSL that describes the winecellar API. The contents of the `app`, `client`, `js`, `schema` and `swagger` folders are all completely generated by the [goagen](http://goa.design/implement/goagen.html) tool from that package. The `controllers` package contains the API business logic and is the only non-generated directory apart from the design package.

The generated documentation for the example API is available on [swagger.goa.design](http://swagger.goa.design/?url=goadesign%2Fgoa-cellar%2Fdesign).
